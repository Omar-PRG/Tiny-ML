# Tiny-ML
TinyML is a type of machine learning that allows models to run on smaller, less powerful devices. As part of our Tiny-Ml course,  we put our homeworks inside this repository. 
The main goal of this project is to integrate machine learning with arduino ide using the arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense MCU and the TensorFlow Lite Library.
