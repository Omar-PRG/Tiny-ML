# Tiny-ML
TinyML is a type of machine learning that allows models to run on smaller, less powerful devices. As part of our Tiny-Ml course,  we put our homeworks inside this repository. 
The main goal of this project is to integrate machine learning with arduino ide using the arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense MCU and the TensorFlow Lite Library. By abusing the ble sensors, we'll train our model on the Yes/No gestures to be able then to predict the gestures we'll do. Please follow up with the provided steps to be able to build your model corrrectly.
