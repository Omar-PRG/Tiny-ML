TinyML, short for "Tiny Machine Learning," involves the implementation of machine learning models on small, low-power devices like microcontrollers. The aim is to make machine learning applications feasible on devices with limited resources such as low processing power and memory.
Unlike traditional machine learning models that are resource-intensive, TinyML focuses on optimizing and designing models for efficient operation on devices with constraints.

This approach opens up possibilities for deploying machine learning in various applications, including sensor data processing, gesture recognition, and voice recognition, among others. By running models directly 
on devices, TinyML enables real-time, on-device inference without the need for continuous communication with a central server. This not only enhances privacy but also reduces latency and improves energy efficiency.
